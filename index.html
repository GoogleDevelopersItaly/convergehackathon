  			<p><strong><a href="http://google.com/">Google</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://frogdesign.com/">frog</a></strong> are bringing together some of the most innovative minds in technology and design. The Converge Hackathon is a platform for the multi-disciplinary collaboration and the exploration of new concepts within the digital sphere; where <strong>ideas, technology and human needs converge</strong>.</p>

  		<h1>How it works</h1>
  		<div class="text">
  			<p>We will provoke your thinking with scenarios that spark your team’s ideation process. From there you will be asked to set your imagination free, so bring your passion to <strong>conceive, design and code inspired ideas.</strong></p>
  			<p>The goal? Having fun while creating ideas with the potential to solve problems, change industries or improve lives – with an eye on the prototype design, execution and presentation.</p>
  		</div>
  
  		<h1>What it is about</h1>
  		<div class="text">
  			<p>This time the Converge Hackathon is going to be about <strong>new ways of experimenting with media</strong>. Here are the challenges you will be asked to tackle:</p>
  
  			<p><strong>SEAMLESS</strong><br> Our media consumption increasingly transcends formats and devices. We expect seamless transitions from TV to mobile to gaming console; or even to use them all simultaneously. What is the next frontier for seamless multi-media interactivity?</p>
   
  			<p><strong>UBIQUITOUS</strong><br> The way we perceive, produce and share information is changing. What does the future hold for our daily terabytes of user-generated content, data and news? And how can we empower mass communication and self-expression for content and creators?</p>
   
  			<p><strong>DEEP</strong><br>What is the future of sensing in media? Will augmented reality deliver on the promise of immersive media? Or will other technologies help realize an experience even richer in context and emotion?</p>
